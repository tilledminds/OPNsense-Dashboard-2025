## Docker

To simplify everything, we'll use a Docker Compose file.

You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on a server that will host the dashboard.

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After you've installed Docker and Docker Compose, download the docker-compose.yaml from this repo.

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml`

It's important that you change the TZ environment variable to your timezone for everything to work properly.
I also recommend you change the passwords in this compose file as well.
After you've made the necessary changes, run `docker-compose up -d` in the same directory as your docker-compose.yaml.
Once you have your docker containers running, follow the steps below.

## Configuring InfluxDB
After InfluxDB is started, go to http://(ip of docker server):8086, you will need to setup your username, password, bucket and organization here. Once that is done navigate to the Data tab, click on Telegraf, and create a configuration for a system (I chose Network Response but I don't think it matters). Name it, and copy your API token, you will need this for your Telegraf configuration. You will also need to generate another API token for Grafana. Click on Load Data -> API tokens -> Generate API Token -> All Access API Token -> Click on your bucket under Read -> and Save. Copy this somewhere as well, you'll need it later for Grafana.


## Configuring Telegraf

### For previous users

If you previously used the pkg install version of telegraf, follow these instructions.

Run `sudo pkg remove telegraf` to remove telegraf.

Delete the line that starts with telegraf in /usr/local/etc/sudoers.

Once those are done you can continue with the new configuration.


### Install the plugin and configure options
Install the Telegraf plugin on OPNsense, to do so, navigate to System -> Firmware -> Plugins -> Search for telegraf, and click the plus icon to install.

![](https://www.bsmithio.com/post/opnsense-dashboard/plugin.png)

Navigate to Services -> Telegraf -> Input

Enable Network and PF Inputs.

![](https://www.bsmithio.com/post/opnsense-dashboard/pfinput.png)

Then click Save.

Now navigate to Services -> Telegraf -> Output

Enable Influx v2 Output and fill in the following:

Influx v2 Token: Your InfluxDB Token

Influx v2 URL: Your InfluxDB URL, this will be the IP address or hostname of your system that is running InfluxDB. E.g http://192.168.1.10:8086

Influx v2 Organization: Your InfluxDB Organization

Influx v2 Bucket: Your InfluxDB Bucket

![](https://www.bsmithio.com/post/opnsense-dashboard/influxbucket.png)

Then click Save.


### Alternative OPNSense Configuration via Ansible

You can use Ansible to automate a few sections. Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html) on your linux server and use the files at https://github.com/bsmithio/OPNsense-Dashboard/tree/master/ansible. If you use this method you can skip these sections: Add telegraf to sudoers, Telegraf Plugins, and Configuration for the Suricata dashboard.

### Add telegraf to sudoers

After that, we need to add telegraf to sudoers and use nopasswd to restrict telegraf to only what it needs to run as root.

```
printf 'telegraf ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/telegraf_pfifgw.php\n' | sudo tee -a /usr/local/etc/sudoers > /dev/null
```

You may also wish to disable sudo logging for telegraf_pfifgw.php, otherwise you'll see many sudo logs from telegraf running the script every 10 seconds.

```
printf 'Cmnd_Alias PFIFGW = /usr/local/bin/telegraf_pfifgw.php\n' | sudo tee -a /usr/local/etc/sudoers > /dev/null
printf 'Defaults!PFIFGW !log_allowed\n' | sudo tee -a /usr/local/etc/sudoers > /dev/null
```

Add the  [custom.conf](./config/custom.conf) telegraf config to /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d

```
sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d
sudo chown telegraf:telegraf /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d
sudo chmod 750 /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com//MansoorMajeed/OPNsense-Dashboard/master/config/custom.conf -o /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d/custom.conf
```

### Telegraf Plugins

**Plugins must be copied to your OPNsense system**

Place [telegraf_pfifgw.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com//tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/plugins/telegraf_pfifgw.php) and [telegraf_temperature.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com//tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/plugins/telegraf_temperature.sh) in /usr/local/bin and chmod them to 755.

```
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com//tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/plugins/telegraf_pfifgw.php" -o /usr/local/bin/telegraf_pfifgw.php
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com//tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/plugins/telegraf_temperature.sh" -o /usr/local/bin/telegraf_temperature.sh
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/telegraf_temperature.sh /usr/local/bin/telegraf_pfifgw.php
```

Test these out before starting the telegraf service by executing them

`sudo telegraf_pfifgw.php`

`telegraf_temperature.sh`

The temperature plugin may not work on every system, if you receive `sysctl: unknown oid 'hw.acpi.thermal'` comment out or remove that line from the plugin.

After this is done, navigate to Services -> Telegraf -> General -> Enable Telegraf Agent.

Lastly, check if Telegraf is running

`sudo service telegraf status`

## Configuring Graylog

### Add GeoIP to Graylog

To make the map work on Grafana, you must create a MaxMind account here https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup. Then generate a license key by going to Account -> Manage License Keys -> Generate New License Key. Copy this key somewhere because you'll need it again soon.

You'll need to download the GeoIP database file to your Graylog container. Access your Graylog container's shell from your Docker host like so:

`sudo docker exec -it graylog /bin/bash`

Then download the database file, replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with your Maxmind account id (this is an integer number, not text) and `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with the key you generated above.

```
curl -J -L -u YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \
'https://download.maxmind.com/geoip/databases/GeoLite2-Country/download?suffix=tar.gz' -o GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz \
&& tar -xzvf GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz \
&& mv GeoLite2-Country_*/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb /usr/share/graylog/data/data/
```

### Configure Additional Settings

In a browser navigate to http://(ip of docker server):9000 and login.

For Graylog, it's recommended to create an index set. To do so, navigate to System -> Indices. Select an Index Set Template (I chose 7 Days Hot) and click Apply template.

Create an index set with the name "OPNsense / filterlog" and set the index prefix to `opnsense_filterlog`. 

![Graylog Index Set](https://www.bsmithio.com/post/opnsense-dashboard/indexset.png)

Leave the other values as defaulted and click Create index set.

Once that's done, download the [content pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/config/OPNsense-pack.json) and install it on Graylog by navigating to System -> Content Packs -> Upload, choose the pack, Upload

Go back to the content packs and install the one you just uploaded

> Note: make sure you actually install the pack you just uploaded

Now, add your index set from earlier to the "OPNsense / filterlog" stream. Navigate to Streams. To the far right of your new index set select More -> Edit Stream and click Update stream.

![Graylog Stream Index Set](https://www.bsmithio.com/post/opnsense-dashboard/streamindex.png)

There's one more step we need to do here, navigate to System -> Configurations -> Message Processors, and reorder like so:

![Graylog Message Processors](https://www.bsmithio.com/post/opnsense-dashboard/processors.png)

Ensure that all of these are enabled, and click save.

### Add Graylog server as syslog target on OPNsense

Once that is all done, login to your OPNsense router and navigate to System -> Settings -> Logging / Remote. Add a new target with the following options:

![OPNsense Syslog Target](https://i.nuuls.com/XQATf.png)

Add a description if you'd like, then click Save.

## Configuring Grafana

### Add InfluxDB and ElasticSearch data sources

You will need to add the data sources on Grafana. Navigate to http://(ip of docker server):3000, login and click Connections -> Data sources and Add new data source.

For InfluxDB, make the following configurations

Query Language: Flux

URL: http://influxdb:8086

Uncheck Basic auth

Organization: Your InfluxDB Organization

Token: Your Grafana InfluxDB API Token

Default Bucket: Your opnsense bucket. This will be the bucket that the panel queries will use.

Click Save & test, this should confirm the data source is connected correctly.

For ElasticSearch, make the following configurations

URL: http://elasticsearch:9200

Time field name: timestamp

Leave all the other values as defaulted.


### Import Dashboard

To import the dashboard, copy the JSON from [OPNsense-Grafana-Dashboard.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilledminds/OPNsense-Dashboard-2025/master/OPNsense-Grafana-Dashboard.json) and navigate to Dashboards -> New -> Import and paste trhe copied JSON into Import via dashboard JSON model.

### Configure Variables

Dashboard Settings -> Variables -> Click on a variable to edit

WAN - $WAN is the variable for our WAN interface panels. It is currently set to igb0 under Custom options. Use a comma-separated list for multiple WAN interfaces.

LAN - $LAN uses a regex to remove any interfaces you don't want to be grouped as LAN. The filtering happens in the "Regex" field. I use a negative lookahead regex to match the interfaces I want excluded.  It should be pretty easy to understand what you need to do here. I have excluded igb0 (WAN),igb2,igb3,ovpnc1, and wg0.

iface - $iface is the interface variable for the Firewall panels, I have it set to igb0 by default. You can either remove igb0 so you can select all interfaces, or use a comma separated list of interfaces.

dataSource - dataSource is the variable for our InfluxDB data source. It is the data source that will be used for all panels with InfluxDB queries. You should see a preview of values you can pick from. Under Instance name filter, use the name of the InfluxDB data source you created for OPNsense if you have multiple InfluxDB data sources.

ESdataSource - ESdataSource is the variable four our Elasticsearch data source. It is the data source that will be used for all panels with Elasticsearch queries. You should see a preview of values you can pick from. Under Instance name filter, use the name of the Elastisearch data source you created for OPNsense if you have multiple Elasticsearch data sources.

Lastly, I don't recommend setting the time range beyond 24 hours, due to how many data points that will return in Grafana.

## Configuration for the Suricata dashboard #Optional
This section assumes you have already configured Suricata.

### Add the necessary files

Add [suricata.conf](./config/suricata/suricata.conf) to /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d

```
sudo curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsmithio/OPNsense-Dashboard/master/config/suricata/suricata.conf' -o /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d/suricata.conf
```

Add [custom.yaml](./config/suricata/custom.yaml) to /usr/local/opnsense/service/templates/OPNsense/IDS

```
sudo curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsmithio/OPNsense-Dashboard/master/config/suricata/custom.yaml' -o /usr/local/opnsense/service/templates/OPNsense/IDS/custom.yaml
```

Create the log file and give telegraf permissions to read it

```
sudo touch /tmp/eve.json
sudo chown :telegraf /tmp/eve.json
sudo chmod 640 /tmp/eve.json
```

### Restart Suricata and Telegraf

Restart Suricata from Services -> Intrusion Detection -> Administration

Uncheck Enabled and click Apply.

Check Enabled and click Apply.

Restart telegraf by running

`sudo service telegraf restart`

### Import the Suricata Dashboard

To import the dashboard, copy the JSON from [OPNsense-Grafana-Dashboard-Suricata.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com//MansoorMajeed/OPNsense-Dashboard/master/OPNsense-Grafana-Dashboard-Suricata.json) and navigate to Dashboards -> Browse -> Import and paste under Import via panel json.

## Troubleshooting

### Telegraf Plugins

- You can run most plugins from a shell/ssh session to verify the output. (the environment vars may be different when telegraf is executing the plugin)
- If you're copying from a windows system, make sure the [CRLF is correct](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-unix-linux-convert-dos-newlines-cr-lf-unix-text-format/)
- The below command should display unix line endings (\n or LF) as $ and Windows line endings (\r\n or CRLF) as ^M$.

`cat -e /usr/local/bin/telegraf_pfifgw.php`

### Telegraf Troubleshooting
If you get no good output from running the plugin directly, try the following command before moving to the step below.

`sudo su -m telegraf -c 'telegraf --test --config /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf --config-directory /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d'`

To troubleshoot plugins further, enable Debug Log and disable Quiet Log in the Telegraf GUI then click Save. Run the above command again.

`sudo su -m telegraf -c 'telegraf --test --config /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf --config-directory /usr/local/etc/telegraf.d'`


### InfluxDB
When in doubt, run a few queries to see if the data you are looking for is being populated.
I recommend doing this in Grafana's Explore tab.

### View measurements
    import "influxdata/influxdb/schema"

    schema.measurements(bucket: "opnsense")

### View field values

    from(bucket: "opnsense")
      |> range(start: -24h)
      |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "system")
      |> limit(n:10)

### How to drop an InfluxDB v2 measurement

You must access your InfluxDB instance's shell to do this.

To do so run

`sudo docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash`

on your docker host.

Then use the following

```
influx delete --bucket "$YourBucket" --predicate '_measurement="$Example"' -o $organization --start "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" --stop "2050-12-31T23:59:00Z" --token "$YourAPIToken"
```

https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/query-data/flux/explore-schema/

### Suricata Troubleshooting

If there is no data on the Suricata dashboard, verify if there are any alerts in /tmp/eve.json.

If there is nothing in /tmp/eve.json, verify that /usr/local/opnsense/service/templates/OPNsense/IDS/custom.yaml and /usr/local/etc/suricata/custom.yaml are identical to the one in this repo.

If /usr/local/etc/suricata/custom.yaml is not identical, but /usr/local/opnsense/service/templates/OPNsense/IDS/custom.yaml is, you will need to reload Suricata from the GUI. To do so you would uncheck Enable in the Suricata GUI, click Apply, then check Enable, and click Apply again. You will need to wait for Suricata to reload. If you have a lot of rules this can take some time. 

If you've verified and done all the steps above, and still see nothing, you could try using [tmNIDS](https://github.com/3CORESec/testmynids.org) to generate alerts. You will need bash installed on your OPNsense system for this. 

`sudo pkg install bash`

Once you have bash installed, you can use this one-liner to download and execute tmNIDS.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3CORESec/testmynids.org/master/tmNIDS -o /tmp/tmNIDS && chmod +x /tmp/tmNIDS && bash /tmp/tmNIDS
```

You can then run the tests through the CLI.

### Map Issues

If you see no GeoIP data on the map make sure you rearranged the Message Processors in System -> Configurations, and reorder like so:
